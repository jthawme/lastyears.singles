The license is essentially this - use this all you want, but if you make any money off of it, you owe me all that money AND a bag of haribo.

I get to choose the Haribo flavour as well, no good going "oh ill just get him some gold bears" nah nahnah, I ain't bashing on gold bears, I _MIGHT_ choose them, but I want that to be my decision.

Also, while we are at it, you have to send me an email once every month with an original poem. It can be a haiku, thats fine, but I want to feel passion in it.

Just don't be a scrot man, I worked on this in my own time because I love this stuff, don't be swooping in, lets chat if you want to, my website is <jthaw.me> and honestly unless something really mad happens, there'll always be contact info on that site, so lessgoooo
